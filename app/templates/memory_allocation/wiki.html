<h1>Memory Allocation</h1>
<h2>MFT</h2>
<p>MFT (Multiprogramming with a Fixed number of Tasks) is one of the old memory management techniques in which the
    memory is partitioned into fixed size partitions and each job is assigned to a partition. The memory assigned to a
    partition does not change.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Algorithms needed to implement Fixed Partitioning are easy to implement. It simply requires putting a
            process into a certain partition without focusing on the emergence of Internal and External Fragmentation.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Disadvantages</li>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Internal Fragmentation</b>: Main memory use is inefficient. Any program, no matter how small, occupies an
            entire partition. This can cause internal fragmentation. </li>
        <li><b>External Fragmentation</b>: The total unused space (as stated above) of various partitions cannot be used
            to load the processes even though there is space available but not in the contiguous form (as spanning is
            not allowed).</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>MVT</h2>
<p>MVT (Multiprogramming with a Variable number of Tasks) is the memory management technique in which each job gets just
    the amount of memory it needs. That is, the partitioning of memory is dynamic and changes as jobs enter and leave
    the system. MVT is a more ``efficient'' user of resources. MFT suffers with the problem of internal fragmentation
    and MVT suffers with external fragmentation.</p>
