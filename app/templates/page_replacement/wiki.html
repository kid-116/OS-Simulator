<h1>Page Replacement Algorithms</h1>
<p>Page replacement algorithms are an important part of virtual memory management and it helps the OS to decide which
    page needs to be replaced when a new page comes in. the ultimate objective of all page replacement algorithms is to
    reduce the number of page faults.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Page</dt>
    <dd>A page, memory page, or virtual page is a fixed-length contiguous block of virtual memory, described by a single
        entry in the page table. It is the smallest unit of data for memory management in a virtual memory operating
        system.</dd>
    <dt>Page Faults</dt>
    <dd>A page fault happens when a running program accesses a memory page that is mapped into the virtual address space
        but not loaded in physical memory.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since actual physical memory is much smaller than virtual memory, page faults happen. In case of a page fault,
    Operating System might have to replace one of the existing pages with the newly needed page.so Different page
    replacement algorithms suggest different ways to decide which page to replace. The target for all algorithms is to
    reduce the number of page faults.</p>
