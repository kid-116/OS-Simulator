<h1>Banker's Algorithm</h1>
<section>
	<h2>Wiki</h2>
	<p>The Banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating
	the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test
	for possible activities, before deciding whether the allocation should be allowed to continue or not.</p>
	<p>The reason behind the naming of the algorithm as such lies in the fact that it is used in the banking system to
	check whether a loan can be sanctioned to a person or not. Suppose there are ‘N’ account holders in a bank and the
	total sum of their money is ‘S’. If a person applies for a loan then the bank first subtracts the loan amount from
	the total amount of money that the bank has and if the resulting difference is greater than S then and only then
	will the loan be sanctioned. This methodology ensures that even in the unlikely possibility that all the account
	holders come to withdraw their money from the bank, the bank can easily do this. Thus the bank would always try to
	remain in a safe state. Banker’s algorithm works in a similar way in computers.</p>
