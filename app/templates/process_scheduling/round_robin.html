<p>Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is simple, easy to implement, and starvation-free as all processes get fair share of CPU.</li>
  <li>One of the most commonly used technique in CPU scheduling as a core.</li>
  <li>It is preemptive as processes are assigned CPU only for a fixed slice of time at most.</li>
  <li>The disadvantage of it is more overhead of context switching.</li>
</ul>
